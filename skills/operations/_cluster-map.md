# Operations Skills Cluster Map

**24 skills** organized into **5 functional clusters**.

---

## Cluster Overview

| Cluster | Purpose | Count | Entry Skill |
|---------|---------|-------|-------------|
| **Diagnose** | Assess current state, identify problems | 7 | `ops-health-check` |
| **Extract** | Get knowledge out of founder's head | 3 | `brain-dump` |
| **Assign** | Transfer ownership to team | 7 | `authority-ladder` |
| **Build** | Create systems and artifacts | 4 | `weekly-rhythm` |
| **Optimize** | Improve what already exists | 3 | `outcome-shifter` |

---

## DIAGNOSE — Assess Current State

> "Where am I? What's wrong? What's the real problem?"

| Skill | Trigger Phrases | Output |
|-------|-----------------|--------|
| `bottleneck-finder` | "I'm the bottleneck," "everything goes through me" | Ranked list of bottlenecks by severity |
| `capacity-planner` | "capacity," "bandwidth," "are we overloaded" | Workload analysis, capacity status |
| `constraint-finder` | "what's slowing us," "one thing to fix" | Single biggest constraint (TOC) |
| `founder-dependency-score` | "bus factor," "could business run without me" | 0-100 dependency score |
| `ops-health-check` | "where should I focus," "operations audit" | Phase scores, priority recommendation |
| `time-audit` | "where's my time going," "always busy" | Time allocation by category |
| `waterline-audit` | "what should I keep," "CEO tasks" | Above/below waterline separation |

**When to use:** Founder isn't sure what's wrong or where to start. Needs data before acting.

**Natural flow:** `ops-health-check` → specific diagnostic → action skill

---

## EXTRACT — Get It Out of Your Head

> "This is all in my head. I need to document it."

| Skill | Trigger Phrases | Output |
|-------|-----------------|--------|
| `brain-dump` | "everything is in my head," "brain dump" | Master inventory of processes |
| `process-mapper` | "document this workflow," "how does this work" | Step-by-step process map |
| `sop-generator` | "SOP," "write this procedure" | Standard operating procedure |

**When to use:** Founder holds tribal knowledge that needs to become visible and shareable.

**Natural flow:** `brain-dump` → `process-mapper` → `sop-generator`

---

## ASSIGN — Transfer Ownership

> "I need to hand this off. Who should own it? How much authority do they get?"

| Skill | Trigger Phrases | Output |
|-------|-----------------|--------|
| `70-percent-rule` | "is this ready to delegate," "good enough" | Delegation readiness assessment |
| `accountability-matrix` | "who owns this," "RACI," "things fall through cracks" | Ownership matrix by function |
| `authority-ladder` | "how much can they decide," "delegation levels" | 5-level authority definition |
| `decision-filter` | "what needs my approval," "reversible decisions" | Type 1 vs Type 2 categorization |
| `handoff-script` | "how do I hand this off," "delegate this" | 7-element delegation script |
| `hire-vs-systemize` | "should I hire or automate" | Quadrant recommendation |
| `team-autonomy-score` | "how independent is my team" | 4-dimension autonomy score |

**When to use:** Founder is ready to delegate but needs structure for how.

**Natural flow:** `authority-ladder` → `70-percent-rule` → `decision-filter` → `handoff-script`

---

## BUILD — Create Systems and Artifacts

> "I need to build something: a dashboard, a rhythm, a tracker."

| Skill | Trigger Phrases | Output |
|-------|-----------------|--------|
| `client-onboarding` | "onboard new clients," "kickoff process" | 5-phase onboarding workflow |
| `project-tracker` | "track project status," "milestones" | Traffic-light project board |
| `scorecard-builder` | "build a dashboard," "KPIs," "metrics" | Function-specific KPI dashboard |
| `weekly-rhythm` | "design my ideal week," "operating cadence" | 5-block weekly structure |

**When to use:** Founder knows what they need and is ready to create it.

**Natural flow:** `outcome-shifter` → `weekly-rhythm` → `scorecard-builder`

---

## OPTIMIZE — Improve What Exists

> "This isn't working well. How do I make it better?"

| Skill | Trigger Phrases | Output |
|-------|-----------------|--------|
| `meeting-audit` | "too many meetings," "calendar review" | Meeting necessity score, cut list |
| `outcome-shifter` | "results not tasks," "measure what matters" | Task-to-outcome conversion |
| `task-categorizer` | "prioritize my tasks," "4-box map" | 4-Box categorization (delegate/keep/eliminate) |

**When to use:** Systems exist but aren't performing. Need refinement, not creation.

**Natural flow:** `task-categorizer` → `outcome-shifter` → `meeting-audit`

---

## Framework Phase Mapping

The clusters map to the Operations Reset Framework phases:

| Phase | Primary Clusters | Purpose |
|-------|------------------|---------|
| **EXTRACT** | Diagnose, Extract | Make the invisible visible |
| **ASSIGN** | Assign | Give team real ownership |
| **SCALE** | Build, Optimize | Create predictable operations |

---

## Cross-Cluster Journeys

### "I don't know where to start"
`ops-health-check` (Diagnose) → Routes to weakest phase

### "I'm drowning in work"
`time-audit` (Diagnose) → `task-categorizer` (Optimize) → `70-percent-rule` (Assign)

### "My team can't function without me"
`founder-dependency-score` (Diagnose) → `brain-dump` (Extract) → `authority-ladder` (Assign)

### "I need to scale"
`ops-health-check` (Diagnose) → `weekly-rhythm` (Build) → `scorecard-builder` (Build)
