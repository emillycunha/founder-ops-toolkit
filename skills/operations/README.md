# Operations Skills

**24 skills** for the Operations Reset Framework. Extract → Assign → Scale.

---

## Quick Start

**Just tell Claude your problem.** You don't need to know which skill to use.

```
"I'm the bottleneck in my business"
"Everything's in my head"
"My team can't decide without me"
"Where should I focus?"
```

The `_router` will match your input to the right skill and execute it.

## The Framework

The Operations Reset Framework has three phases:

| Phase | Goal | You're stuck here if... |
|-------|------|-------------------------|
| **EXTRACT** | Make the invisible visible | Everything's in your head, no documentation |
| **ASSIGN** | Give team real ownership | Team checks with you on everything |
| **SCALE** | Create predictable operations | Chaos week-to-week, no rhythm or metrics |

Each phase builds on the previous. You can't assign what isn't visible. You can't scale what isn't owned.
